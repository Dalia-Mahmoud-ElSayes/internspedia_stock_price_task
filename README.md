I have implemented Linear Regression model and LSTM in two ways 

1-cleaned data

.drop unnecessary columns 

.check for duplication 

.check for outliers using boxblot and skewness

2-Feature Scaling

.standard scaler for linear regression

.MinMax Scaler for LSTM with range 0 to 1

3-fitting linear regression model 

4-Building LSTM model

5-Training model
